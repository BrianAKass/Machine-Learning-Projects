    "* What is ML? \n",
    "\n",
    "* method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. \n",
    "\n",
    "* using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, ML allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.\n",
    "\n",
    "* used for but not limited to: \n",
    "    * Fraud detection, web search results, real time ads on webpages, credit scoring and next best offers, prediction of equipment failures, new pricing models, network intrusion detection, recommendation engines, customer segmentation, text, sentiment analysis, predicting  customer churn, pattern and imgage recognition, email spam filtering, financial modeling and more. \n",

    "#### Threee types of ML Algorithms:\n",
    "* Supervised learning\n",
    "* unsupervised Learning\n",
    "* Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Supervised Learning\n",
    "* you have labeled data and are trying to group together similar data points based off of features \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "* You have unlabeled data and are trying to group together similar points based off of features \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "* Algorithm learns to perform an action from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "##### Supervised Learning\n",
    "* supervised Learning algorithms are trained using Labeled examples such as an imput where the desired output is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example a piece of equipment could have data points labeled either 'F' (failed) or 'R' (runs).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Learning algorithm recieves a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* it then modifies the model accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* through methods like classification regression prediction and graidient boosting supervisied learning uses patterns to predict the values of the label on addtional unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical predicts likely future events. \n",
    "\n",
    "* example can anticipate when credit card fraud transactions are likely to be fraudulent or when insurance customer is likely to file a claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Or it can attempt to predict the price of a house based on different features for houses for which we have historical price data. \n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "##### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* is used against data that has no historical labels \n",
    "\n",
    "* not told the 'right answer'. algorithm must figure out on it's own \n",
    "\n",
    "* goal is to explore the data and find some structure within. \n",
    "\n",
    "* can find the main attributes that spearate customer segments from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "* popular techniques include self-organizing maps, nearest-neighbor mapping, k-means clustering and singular value decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* these algorithms are also used to segment text topics, recommend items and identify data outliers.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "##### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "* often used for robotics gaming and navigation. \n",
    "* with reinforcement learning , the algorithm discovers through trial and error which actions yiled the greatest rewards. \n",
    "* this type of learning has three primary components the agent (learner or decision maker), enviorment  (everything it interacts with) and actions (what the agent can do)\n",
    "\n",
    "* objective for the agent to choose actions that maximize the expected reward over a given amount of time. \n",
